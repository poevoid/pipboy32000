# pipboy32000
pipboy type OS for the arduboy!

Use LEFT and RIGHT to select which menu is presented, shown at the bottom in abbreviations. There are four menus: Inventory, USB, Map, and Radio. 
Inventory allows you to keep track of geocache locations by editing information in-sketch. Completely MIT licensed, so no need to worry about anything, just have fun, yo. 
USB allows you to use your new pipboy as a USB interface, either executing commands or being implemented as a game controller. 
Map is just a monochrome PNG of the area. default is Houston!
Radio plays chiptune-type versions of popular songs throughout the wasteland! also features a fake sine wave.

Press B on any screen (except when used as a game controller) to toggle the RGB led as a flashlight and show vault-boy again!
Press A on vault-boy screen to toggle flashlight off.
